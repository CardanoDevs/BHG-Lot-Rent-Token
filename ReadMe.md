# CTO Rentable Token

## Quantity- 292,201,338

- It should be a token that only can be rented out for a 24h 48h and so on( by day let’s say) so the coefficient of time and the calendar reference must be linked and updatet every 24 h and collect back the token once the rent fees expire. 

- The rented One token can be anything’s value but One tokens value be determined by the market capital formed from sales of: a LOT product which is supposed to perform a function,+ transaction fee coefficient or rate +tax coefficient,+other related fees and expenses.

- I got a small cherry on the top of this which is sales tax at any rental transaction, you can use the burning technique for the renal layer by marketing the sales tax as rental tax so to wrap up with a if (the amount payed in any crypto) then (LOT token function that can carry/store safely a/multiple barcodes (amount of data) with one point of access( one chip scan to access the data) later we will work on recognition system for the barcodes)

- One token has same value as the rest of them but is identified differently and it caries info needed for one single transaction (is like a receipt- transaction data in the envelope - token) after the transaction is delivered the envelope is recycled but the costumer dada stored on the platform - room(server) for another transaction purpose.

- Borrowed only on the platform ( in this case I think centralized but I will take your advice here).
Also transferable to other users on this platform and recycled after the token is exchanged to other currencies.

- One Lot must equal: transaction fees 0.1% fixed changeable + interest rate if borrowed %fixed changeable + LOCATION sales tax % (ex: New York - 4%) fixed changeable + LOT price dependent on number of transactions upgraded every hours, minutes, seconds.

- when the maximum number X= 292,201,338 of tokens is in use I want to activate the 2X multiply x with 2 then 3X, 4X and so on but when they are not used the total number decreases to X in dependence on which segment the in use number falls on.
